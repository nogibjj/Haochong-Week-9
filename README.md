This is a repo template for course 706_Data_Engineering Week 9 mini project. I use the 2018 world cup prediction to perform data manipulation by creating a Cloud-Hosted Notebook . I use Action to run `Makefile` and got a 100% pass. 

Important file:
* `Week 9 mini.ipynb`

# Purpose
- Set up a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook (e.g., Google Colab)
- Perform data manipulation tasks on a sample dataset
